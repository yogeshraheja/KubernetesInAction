- kubectl get nodes
- kubectl describe node <Node-Name>| grep -i taint

- kubectl taint nodes k8sworker1 company=thinknyx:NoSchedule

- kubectl describe node k8sworker1  | grep -i taint
Taints:             company=thinknyx:NoSchedule

To Set a Taint:

kubectl taint node <nodename>  key=value:effect     (effect can be NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule, NoExecute)

To Unset a Taint:

kubectl taint node <nodename> key-

OR

kubectl taint node <nodename> key=value:effect-

CASE1: Now create a deployment with 3 replicas and you will see the POD will not get created on this node as the POD is not having tolerations set


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: yogeshappdep
  labels:
    app: yogeshapp
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: yogeshapp-pod
      labels:
        app: yogeshapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: devopsinaction
        image: yogeshraheja/devopsinaction:v1

  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: yogeshapp


CASE2: Now add tolerations and you will see the pods are getting created on TAINTED node also along with other nodes:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: yogeshappdepagain
  labels:
    app: yogeshappagain
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: yogeshappagain-pod
      labels:
        app: yogeshappagain
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: devopsinaction
        image: yogeshraheja/devopsinaction:v1
      tolerations:
        - key: company
          value: thinknyx
          operator: Equal
          effect: NoSchedule

  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: yogeshappagain
