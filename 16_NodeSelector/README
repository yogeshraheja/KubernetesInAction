Node Labels:
------------
You can also use labels to tag nodes

Once nodes are tagged, you can use label selectors to let pods only run specific nodes

there are two steps required to run a pod on a specific set of nodes

- first you tag the node
- then you add a nodeSelector to your pod configuration 
====================


kubectl get nodes
kubectl get nodes --show-labels

Run the below yaml file and check the pod status you will find the error stating "node(s) didn't match node selector."

kubectl create -f <yamlfile>

kubectl get pods

kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

ERROR will be like:
===================
Events:
  Type     Reason            Age                From               Message

  Warning  FailedScheduling  11s (x2 over 11s)  default-scheduler  0/3 nodes are available: 3 node(s) didn't match node selector.


nodeselector.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: httpd-container
    image: httpd
  nodeSelector:
    company: thinknyx


Case two:
========

As soon as you label the node you will get the POD in running condition (auto-healing)

kubectl label nodes <nodename> company=thinknyx
kubectl label nodes <nodename> hardware=low-spec


Change the nodeSelector to other node and re-run.
