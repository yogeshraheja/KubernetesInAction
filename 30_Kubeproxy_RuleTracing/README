# Complete Flow for tracing network 

- Create one deployment with 2 replicas

- Create one service and assosicate it with the deployment

- iptables -t nat (check all nat tables createfd inside a host)
- iptables -t nat -L PREROUTING (filter PREROUNTING and see KUBE-SERVICES iptables chain)
- iptables -t nat -L KUBE-SERVICES (Now find the service name you have created)
- iptables -t nat -L KUBE-SVC-YOURSVC (this will list all endpoints i.e PODIP:80 --> SEP stands for Service Endpoint Chain)
- iptables -t nat -L KUBE-SEP-#### (This will display the DNAT (destination network address translation) rule)
