Once the file are deployed follow below process to Add DashBoard to your Grafana:

There are many prebuilt Grafana templates available for various data sources "https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards?search=kubernetes"

Step 1: Get the template ID from grafana public template.

Example 8588 (I took)

Step 2: Head over to grafana and select the import option from (+) create button.

Step 3: Enter the dashboard ID you got it step 1 and import it

Step 4: Grafana will automatically fetch the template from Grafana website. You can change the values as shown in the image below and click import.
