# Create a namespace <yourname>ns and create one pod named <yourname>pod inside your newly created ns

- kubectl create ns
- kubectl run

# Now create a service of type nodeport <yourname>svc inside your newly created ns

- kubectl create svc nodeport yournamesvc --tcp=80:80

# Now find the nodeport details and try to access your application from the browser. You will see it won't work.

# Now trouble shooting starts

- kubectl get pods --show-labels
- kubectl get sec --show-labels
- kubectl describe sec <yourname>svc      ---> You will see the selector is different than POD labels

# To fix the same either change the selector or put a new label for your pod.

- kubectl label pod <yourname>pod app=yournamesvc

# Switch back to the browser and see if that works :)
