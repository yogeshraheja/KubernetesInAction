- Installation and setup
- Cluster scale out (Adding a new node)
- Drain a node 

kubectl drain nodename
kubectl uncordon nodename

Note: add one deployment with two or more replicas to show drain
- Cordon and Uncordon a node

kubectl cordon nodename
kubectl uncordon nodename

- Cluster scale in (Removing an old node)

kubectl drain nodename
kubectl delete node nodename
kubeadm reset (on client)

- Decommissioning of K8S cluster

kubectl drain nodename
kubectl delete node nodename
kubeadm reset (on client)

kubectl delete node nodename (master name)
kubeadm reset
Remove kubeconfig file  (rm -rf /root/.kube* & rm -rf /etc/kubernetes*)
Remove calico network also (rm -rf /etc/cni/net.d)

- Installation and setup with old version (1.16)

yum remove kube* (all nodes and hash out the exclude from repos, also use --show-duplicate with yum list to see all versions)

Error Faced : --> Processing Dependency: kubernetes-cni >= 0.7.5 for package: kubelet-1.17.0-0.x86_64
Package kubernetes-cni is obsoleted by kubelet, but obsoleting package does not provide for requirements

Solution is to add --setopt=obsoletes=0 during installation

yum install kubeadm-1.16.0-0 kubelet-1.16.0-0 kubectl-1.16.0-0 --setopt=obsoletes=0

And then rest of the setup

- Scale out a node to have 3 node cluster

- Kubernetes upgrade process from 1.16 to 1.17

upgrade kubeadm on controlnode first
then update kubectl and kubelet on the controler node
